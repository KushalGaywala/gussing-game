# ઈમ્પોસ્ટર — Gujarati Imposter Game

A pass-the-phone **Imposter** party game (like the famous "undercover / imposter" word game)
built entirely in Gujarati, with English meanings in brackets. Runs fully offline as an
installable **PWA** — no accounts, no server, no network required.

## How to play

1. **ગોઠવણ / Setup** — choose the number of **players** and **imposters**. Optionally name players and pick a word category. Save the setup as a **preset** for next time.
2. **જુઓ / Reveal** — pass the phone around. Each player **holds the card and pulls it down** to peek at their secret word; **releasing snaps the card back** and hides it again. Only then does **Next** unlock — so nobody can see the previous player's word, and peeking again is a visible gesture everyone would notice.
3. Everyone gets the **same Gujarati word** — except the **imposter(s)**, who get no word and must bluff.
4. **ચર્ચા / Discuss** — each player gives one clue about the word (without saying it). Use the built-in timer.
5. **મત / Vote or Skip** — at the end of each discussion the group either **votes a player out** or **skips the round**. Voting a player out reveals whether they were an imposter or innocent.
6. **રાઉન્ડ / Rounds** — if the game isn't over, a **suggesting round** is followed by another **discussion round**, then vote or skip again. This repeats until someone wins.
7. **જીત / Win** — **civilians win** once every imposter has been voted out; **imposters win** the moment they equal or outnumber the surviving civilians. The result (with round count) is saved to **History**.

## Features

- **250+ Gujarati words** across 16 categories (animals, food, places, festivals, and more) — Gujarati with English in brackets.
- **Manual setup** — any number of players (3–20) and imposters (1 to players−1).
- **Presets** — save/load game configurations (IndexedDB).
- **Score history** — every finished game (word, players, imposters, winner) stored locally (IndexedDB).
- **Hold-to-peek card** pass-the-phone flow — the word is only visible while the card is held down, so passing the phone is cheat-proof.
- **Round-based voting** — each round the group votes a player out or skips; ejected roles are revealed and win conditions (all imposters out ⇒ civilians win; imposters reach parity ⇒ imposters win) are checked automatically. Suggesting and discussion rounds alternate until someone wins.
- **Language modes** — a dropdown in the top-right toggles between **Hybrid** (Gujarati primary + English secondary, the default) and **Normal** (Gujarati only). The choice is saved and applied everywhere, with no flash of secondary text on load.
- Discussion **timer** with quick presets, progress bar and vibration on time-up.
- **Offline-first PWA** — service worker caches the whole app shell.
- **Installable** on Android/desktop; foundations included for **TWA** (Trusted Web Activity).

## Tech

Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no build step, no dependencies.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.html` | App shell / all screens |
| `css/style.css` | Mobile-first dark theme |
| `js/vocab.js` | Gujarati↔English word list + categories |
| `js/db.js` | IndexedDB wrapper (presets + history) |
| `js/icons.js` | Inline SVG icon set (self-contained, no sprite/`<use>`) |
| `js/app.js` | Router, game logic, hold-to-peek card, timer |
| `manifest.webmanifest` | PWA manifest |
| `sw.js` | Service worker (offline cache) |
| `icons/` | App icons — SVG + raster PNG (192/512, incl. maskable) |
| `.well-known/assetlinks.json` | TWA Digital Asset Links template |
| `Dockerfile` / `nginx.conf` | One-click Coolify deploy (static site on nginx) |
| `twa-manifest.json` | Bubblewrap TWA config (set your host) |
| `scripts/build-twa.sh` | One-command Android TWA build + assetlinks wiring |

## Running locally

A service worker requires an HTTP origin (not `file://`). Serve the folder with any static server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Or run the exact production image locally:

```bash
docker build -t imposter .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 imposter
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

## Deploying on Coolify

> For the full, step-by-step walkthrough (Coolify + Bubblewrap, verification,
> troubleshooting) see **[DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)**.

The repo ships a `Dockerfile` (nginx serving the static shell), so Coolify
deploys it with **one click, no configuration**:

1. In Coolify, **+ New → Resource → Public/Private Repository** and point it at
   this repo.
2. Coolify auto-detects the `Dockerfile` build pack. Leave the defaults — the
   container listens on **port 8080** (already `EXPOSE`d).
3. Set your domain and let Coolify provision HTTPS (Let's Encrypt). That's the
   single deploy — the same container serves the PWA, the web manifest, and the
   Digital Asset Links needed for the Android wrapper.

The bundled [`nginx.conf`](nginx.conf) handles the PWA-specific details Coolify's
generic static server would miss:

- `manifest.webmanifest` → `application/manifest+json`
- `.well-known/assetlinks.json` → `application/json`, CORS-open (TWA verification)
- `sw.js` / manifest → `no-cache` so a redeploy never leaves clients on a stale shell
- long-lived caching + gzip for `css/js/png/svg`

## Packaging as a TWA (Android) — one command

The PWA is TWA-ready: it ships raster icons (`icons/icon-512.png`,
`icons/icon-maskable-512.png`, referenced from the manifest) that
[Bubblewrap](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/bubblewrap) requires, plus a
pre-filled [`twa-manifest.json`](twa-manifest.json).

After the site is deployed over HTTPS, build the Android app in one step:

```bash
./scripts/build-twa.sh yourdomain.com
```

The script:

1. Rewrites `twa-manifest.json` to your host.
2. Runs `bubblewrap build` (generating `android.keystore` on first run) to
   produce the signed `.apk` (sideload) and `.aab` (Google Play).
3. Reads the signing **SHA-256** from the keystore and writes the real
   `.well-known/assetlinks.json`.

Commit the updated `assetlinks.json` and **redeploy** so
`https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json` serves your fingerprint —
domain verification (URL-bar-free launch) is live from that deploy on.

Prereqs for the build step: Node 18+, JDK 17+, and the Android SDK (Bubblewrap
can fetch its own on first run).
